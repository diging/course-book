    <h1>Class Calendar</h1>
    <p>We meet three times a week:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mondays (with lecture)</li>
        <li>Tuesdays or Wednesdays (depending on what session you chose)</li>
        <li>Thursdays or Fridays (depending on what session you chose)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We have a few holidays this semester:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>September 7, 2015</b> (Labor Day)</li>
        <li><b>October 12-13, 2015</b> (Fall break)
            <br><i>Note:</i> Because there is no class on Tuesday (10/12), we also won't meet on Wednesday (10/13).
        </li>
        <li><b>November 11, 2015</b> (Veteran's Day)</li>
        <li><b>November 26-27, 2015</b> (Thanksgiving)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to that, there are a few days when we won't meet in class but you are expected to work on your projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>September 10-11, 2015</b></li>
        <li><b>September 21-25, 2015</b></li>
        <li><b>November 23-25, 2015</b> (Monday through Wednesday before Thanksgiving)
        <br> This week is the last week before the finals week, so you should prepare your presentations.
    </li>
    </ul>
