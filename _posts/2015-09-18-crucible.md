To make it as easy as possible to help you with coding, we set up a Crucible server on our DigInG server:
[http://diging.asu.edu/fisheye](http://diging.asu.edu/fisheye)

This page describes how you can use it to request help from us. First of all, create an account in Crucible and then login. You should see something like this:

![Crubile Dashboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/start.png)

To start a new review, click on the "Create Review" button on the top of the page. You will be asked to select a project. Select the one you are working on. If you have a question/review request that falls outside of our projects (e.g. for a tutorial), select the "Default Project." Then click on "Create Review."

Next, you will be asked what you want to have reviewed. You will see a screen like this:

![Create new review]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/choose.png)

In most cases you likely will choose either the first (Browse Changeset) or the second (Choose Branch) option, which allows you to either choose a specific commit for review or choose a whole branch.

If you choose to browse for a specific changeset (or commit), you will see a screen like this:

![Select changeset]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/changeset.png)

If you choose to select a specific branch for review, your screen will look like this:

![Select branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/branch.png)

Select the branch that should be reviewed from the drop-down menu and click "Add branch."

You can add more files for review by clicking on the button "Add More Content" at the bottom of the window.

Once you've added all the files you would like to have reviewed, click on "Done."

You're screen should now show a navigator panel on the left side with all the files to be reviewed, some general information on the top, and if you select a file in the navigator, the changes that were made to that file since the last commit will be shown.

![Review Window]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/review_window.png)

Click on the button "Edit Details" on the right upper corner. A details window will open. Enter a title for your review and if not already filled, select a reviewer (usually that would be Erick or Julia but you can also use this to have a classmate review your code). If there is a JIRA ticket associated with this review, enter its ticket id (e.g. QUAD-12) into the field labeled "Linked issue" and click "Link."

![Edit review details]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/review_details.png)

When you are all set up, click on the button "Start Review" in the upper right corner of your review window. The review details will now show your reviewer and their progress.

![Review started]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/review_started.png)

The reviewer can now review your code and make comments on specific lines. If you stay on the review page, Crucible will inform you when new comments are added. You can also respond to comments:

![Comments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/comments.png)

When the reviewer completet their review, you sill see a little complete indicator at the top of the review page:

![Reviewers are done]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/crucible/reviewer-done.png)

Once you are done with the review and looked at all the comments, click "Close" at the top of the page to close the review.

If you linked a JIRA issue to your review, JIRA will show the review and its status on the issue page.
