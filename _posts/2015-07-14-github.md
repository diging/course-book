Most of our projects are hosted on GitHub. In the beginning of the class you will learn how to use Git and GitHub. You will therefore need an account on GitHub. Please create your account by registering [here](https://github.com/join). Choose the free plan and don't create an organization. We will add you to the DigInG organization, once you start working on our projects.

Don't forget to add a picture of yourself to your GitHub profile!
