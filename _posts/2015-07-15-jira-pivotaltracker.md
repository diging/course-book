We use several different issue tracking systems for our projects. Depending on what project you are working on, you will need an account in [Jira](https://diging.atlassian.net/) and/or [Pivotaltracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/). Once you have created an account let us know what your username is and we will add you to our projects.

# Pivotal Tracker Tutorial

We'll go over how to use Pivotal Tracker in class. [These videos](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/gettingstarted) also provide an excellent introduction to Pivotal Tracker and Agile development in general.

# JIRA Tutorials

JIRA is a bit more complicated than Pivotal Tracker, but also more powerful. [These tutorials](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/JIRA+Agile+Documentation) are an excellent resource.
