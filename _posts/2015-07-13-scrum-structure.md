In DigInG we follow an agile methodology, specifically Scrum. You will work in small teams, which each has:

- a product owner,
- a scrum master,
- and a development team.

The product owner is the person who knows the product under development and makes decisions about what features should be implemented in what order. The scrum master helps facilitating the scrum process and supports the development team by for example communicating with other parties (e.g. sysadmins) to remove road blocks. The development team is a (diverse) group of people working on developing software.  It usually includes software enginieers, testers, software architects, and others.
