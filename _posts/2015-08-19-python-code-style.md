title: Python Code Cleanliness - PEP8
published: true
---

For Python code, we will follow the [PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). To ensure that your code conforms to PEP8, we will use a tool called [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/). You should run Pylint before committing changes on a project.

You can install Pylint from the Python Package Index using ``pip``:

```bash
$ pip install pylint
```
