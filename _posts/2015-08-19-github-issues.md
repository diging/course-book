We use the GitHub Issues tracking system for bug reporting and feature requests. If something doesn't behave as expected when you're using our software, you should report it by creating a new issue on that project's GitHub page.

[This article](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) provides an excellent introduction to the Issue tracker on GitHub. We really like the Adobe Brackets guide for bug reporting, [here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue). To steal from their guide, each bug report should include the following:

* **Descriptive title** - use keywords so others can find your bug (avoiding duplicates)
* **Steps to trigger** the problem that are specific, and repeatable
* What happens when you follow the steps, and what you **expected** to happen instead.
* Include the exact text of any **error messages** if applicable (or upload screenshots).
* **Software version** (or if you're pulling directly from Git, your current commit SHA - use ``git rev-parse HEAD``)
* Did this work in a **previous version**? If so, also provide the version that it worked in.
